# **CrateDigger**

**Problem:**

I seem to find record shops when I least expect it, and I’m never prepared for it. I can’t seem to keep track of what is in my current collection and I cant remember what releases I want to pick up. I sometimes avoid going into shops because I don’t have enough time to dig through all the crates to refresh my memory. If only I had some kind of collection database with a wish list feature that I could access from anywhere. 

**Solution:**

Step 1: Build Crate Digger.

Step 2: Go buy records.

## **Back-End**
Back-End Repo:

**MongoDB + Node.js + Express**

The site has three collections that stores the users information, the main vinyl collection, and a wish-list collection. The data models for the vinyl and wish-list collections are comprised of 12 different fields, 11 are used to store the incoming information from the Discogs api request from the front end and the final links the album to the user. The user is authenticated with JWT-Passport an authenticating middleware that extracts a JSON web token which is created in the sign-in response.  Validation for the user is handled through validation middleware that uses the validator library.

**Discogs API**

Discogs  is a digital marketplace for users from around the world to buy and sell music in physical formats. The site has a rich music database and gives users the ability to catalog their collections.  Discogs provides acces to their API for developers looking to make  projects using their database. Crate Digger utilizes the Discogs Api to find vinyl record specific releases. 

<br/>

## **Front-End**


**React + React-Bootstrap**

Crate Digger is designed to focus the abilities of the Discogs API to vinyl specific releases, and allow a curation of the user’s personal library, and to help make quick purchasing decisions. A mobile and full browser work flow are both necessary to achieve the goals of the site. With that in mind the front-end is styled with React-Bootstrap, Chart.js library to visualize user data, and React-Toastify for alerts.
